# Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification 🎮

This project is a **Deep Learning model** built to classify images of the popular game **Rock-Paper-Scissors** 🪨📄✂️.  
It uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and deployed with a simple **Gradio interface** for interactive testing.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a CNN model using **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Applied **Data Augmentation** techniques (rotation, shift, zoom, shear) to improve generalization.
- Achieved **~99% validation accuracy** 🎯.
- Created a **Gradio app** that allows users to upload an image and instantly get a prediction (Rock / Paper / Scissors).
